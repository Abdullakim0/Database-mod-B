# Granting Privileges in MySQL (Version 5.7.6 and later)

To grant privileges to a user in MySQL (version 5.7.6 and later), follow these steps:

Step 1: Log into MySQL
First, access your MySQL container using the root user:

docker exec -it <mysql-container-name> mysql -u root -p

Step 2: Grant All Privileges
Use the following command to grant all privileges to a specific user (user in this example) from any host (%):

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'user'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;

 'user' is replaceable.

Note: Granting ALL PRIVILEGES on *.* is generally not recommended for production environments due to security reasons. 

Step 3: Flush Privileges
After granting privileges, flush the privileges to apply the changes:

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
These steps will enable to efficiently grant the requisite privileges to MySQL user, thereby resolving any ERROR 1064 syntax issues encountered.
